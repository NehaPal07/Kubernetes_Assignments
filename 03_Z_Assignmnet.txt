Learning Objectives:-
Create a yaml file containing the pod spec for the nginx pod.
Create the pod.


Your company is getting ready to launch a new website, and they need you to set up an nginx web server in their Kubernetes cluster. 
The nginx server will need to be accessible via network in the future, so you will need to expose port 80 as a containerPort for the nginx container. 
Your team has also asked you to ensure that nginx runs in quiet mode for the time being to cut down on unnecessary log output. 
You can do this by setting the command to nginx and passing the following arg to the container: -g daemon off; -q. As this nginx server belongs 
to the Web team, you will need to create it in the team's web namespace.

To summarize:

Use the nginx container image.
The container needs a containerPort of 80.
Set the command to nginx
Pass in the -g daemon off; -q args to run nginx in quiet mode.
Create the pod in the web namespace.
Once the pod is created, you should be able to find it with kubectl get pods -n web. Once the pod is created, 
you can get more information about its current status with kubectl describe pod nginx -n web.


Solution:

ubuntu@master-node:~$ kubectl create ns web
namespace/web created

vi nginx.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
 labels:
  app: nginx-app
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
   image: nginx:latest
   command: ["nginx","-g","daemon off;","-q"]
   ports:
   - containerPort: 8080

ubuntu@master-node:~$ kubectl create -f nginx.yml -n web
pod/nginx-pod created

ubuntu@master-node:~$ kubectl get pods -n web
